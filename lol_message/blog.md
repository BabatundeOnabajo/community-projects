# Lol Message


## Background

During the [Courier Hack](https://courier-hacks.devpost.com/), I wanted to build a project that was fun and easy to use. So I decided to build an anonymous message, feedback, and suggestion box just like `NGL.link` with email notification and a dashboard to view all the recieved messages. 

So I decided to use the following tools and technologies:

- Courier for the notifications
- Next.js for the frontend 
- tRPC for the backend
- Supabase for the database and authentication
- Mantine for the UI
