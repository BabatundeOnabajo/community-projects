# Coffee Mate

## Background

CoffeeMate helps users start their day reading about latest developments in areas of their interest without getting distracted by social media or drowning themselves in a sea of emails, notifications or even endless scrolling on a news app. CoffeeMate does this by sending registered users an email every morning with news articles from categories that they selected.

We used are HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS for the frontend and Node.js and Express.js for the backend of our website.
