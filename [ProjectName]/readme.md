# How to use the Interest Rate Watcher?

## Background
The Interest Rate Watcher was built to monitor interest rate changes made by central banks and to notify end users about said changes. With both the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the global economy has been in a precarious situation which has made interest rates set by central banks more volatile. Interest rates set by central banks are an important policy tool and affect everything from the cost of a mortgage through to student loan financing. This program was created to ease the process of informing users of changes made by central banks. 

The Interest Rate Watcher was built in PHP and MySQL. PHP was chosen because of its popularity in the web development scene. MySQL was chosen for similar reasons, and because of its seamless integration with PHP. To use the program, it is highly recommended to use a cron job on Linux/Linux-based systems or to use Windows Task Scheduler on Windows systems.
